## Activity Objectives

Throughout this activity, you'll practice the following skills.

+ You'll build a public web-presence via a GitHub pages website.
+ You'll populate that page with some basic information.
+ You'll add a link to your technical report, so that it is viewable by someone who finds your GitHub page.

**Note:** If you are uncomfortable with having a public web page, please speak with Dr. Duryea or Dr. Gilbert -- there are alternatives and you are not being forced to put your information on the web.

## Your Tasks

Please complete the following tasks. 

1. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/o5g-lUuFgpg) and follow the steps to create your own webpage hosted by GitHub.
2. Choose a template / style if you like, and apply it to your site.
3. Update the `README/index` using markdown syntax to organize your page. Add whatever information you like to it.
4. Add a link to your report (the `*.html` version) and verify that you can view your written report from the link on your website.
